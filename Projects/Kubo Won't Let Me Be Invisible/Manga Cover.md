These are edited clean version of manga covers using the images released from various sources. The manga cover for Volumes 5 and 7 has been skipped (for now) as it is very difficult to remove the watermark.

## Editing Process

Watermark removal was generally done through layer masking of different images and blending them, and by using other minor tools. Adobe Photoshop was used to edit these stuff.

Other specific editing processes that I have done are noted below:

- `Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible - Manga Cover - Vol. 3`, and `Vol. 4` - The PR TIMES version has a lot of artifacts so I slightly denoised it using waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan without doing an upscale.
- `Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible - Manga Cover - Vol. 5`, `Vol. 7`, `Vol. 11`, and `Vol. 12` - Watermark was removed using lama-cleaner, in which I used the LaMa model as it yield better results than other models. Some minimal touches were done afterwards in Adobe Photoshop.
- `Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible - Manga Cover - Vol. 6` - The left side was heavily modified to remove the watermark, and I hope it looks good enough.
- `Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible - Manga Cover - Vol. 9` - The left portion was heavily modified as I have to recreate a lot of stuff. Because Iâ€™m not yet good enough in Photoshop, the results may not look good if you zoomed in and look carefully. I might probably redo this one in the future.
