## Editing Process

I used the images from Twitter and from the website of the anime. Both are slightly denoised using waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan due to artifacts. No upscale has been done with this method. The text and logo watermark on the top and the bottom was removed through layer masking of different images and blending them. Patch tool was used to remove the watermark on the bottom-right.
